 * bios_sigsearch
 *

 *		to start the search from the base of the BIOS.
 *		Note that this will be a _physical_ address in
 *		the range 0xe0000 - 0xfffff.
 * (sig)	is a pointer to the byte(s) of the signature.
 * (siglen)	number of bytes in the signature.
 * (paralen)	signature paragraph (alignment) size.
 * (sigofs)	offset of the signature within the paragraph.
 *
 * Returns the _physical_ address of the found signature, 0 if the
 * signature was not found.
